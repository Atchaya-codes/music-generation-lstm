# 🎵 Music Generation using LSTM

This project demonstrates how to generate music using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model.,this implementation trains on a dataset of MIDI files and learns to generate sequences of musical notes.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🎶 Converts MIDI files into sequences of musical notes
- 🧠 Trains an LSTM neural network to predict the next note
- 🎼 Generates new music by sampling predictions
- 🔊 Saves the output as a playable MIDI file
-🎵 This notebook uses input MIDI files from  Kaggle dataset https://www.piano-midi.de/
